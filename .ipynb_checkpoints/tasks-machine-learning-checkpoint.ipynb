Starting with an initial guess for the square root, $s_0$, the algorithm computes a better guess using the formula\n",

    "With Newton's method, setting the initial guess to be slightly larger than the root will result in slightly faster convergence than a guess that is slightly smaller than the root [2]. I have hard-coded the initial guess ($s_0 = 1$) into my algorithm because we have been asked to calculate the square root of a fixed number, $ x = 2$. In general, the initial guess should be between 1 and the number, and initial guesses closer to the root will converge faster. We already roughly know the answer to this task, $\\sqrt 2 \\approx 1.4$, and so an initial guess anywhere between 1 and 1.4 will work fine. Much more consideration of the initial guess would be required if we had been asked to calculate the square root of *any* number. The further the initial guess is from the actual answer, the more iterations are \"wasted\" just getting to the vicinity of the answer [2]."

    "### A little note about accuracy\n",
    "I'm a tiny bit suspicious of all those zeros at the end of the number. We discussed in week 2 of this module how $\\sqrt 2$ is an irrational number: it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers so its decimal expansion never becomes periodic. My algorithm is producing a periodic decimal expansion (repeated zeros), so although it's a very good approximation of $\\sqrt 2$, it is not exactly $\\sqrt 2$. The algorithm takes 4 iterations to converge with tolerance set to 0.0000000001. Newton's method has a quadratic rate of convergence, meaning that the number of correct bits, or decimal places, (n) doubles with each iteration; the required number of iterations is of order $O(\\log_2 n)$ [6]. We have been asked for 100 decimal places, so we would need about $\\log_2 100 \\approx 4.6$ iterations However, the running time of this algorithm scales as $O( n (\\log_2 n )^2)$ [6]. This implies that requiring 100 bits of precision will cause the algorithm to take about 2000 times longer to run than for 10 bits. In the code as written above, some improvement in accuracy can probably be achieved by decreasing tolerance, but it's not the only contributor to the precision of the answer. I might come back to this as I don't want to get bogged down at this stage. The main reason for the rational appearance of $\\sqrt 2$ comes from the fact that computers store numbers and do arithmetic in floating point format [7]. I found a Stack Overflow post that explains this really well using the easy-to-understand example of repeatedly halving a pizza [8]. You can do the halving 53 times before the slice is too small for even a high-precision cutter. At that point, you can no longer halve that very thin slice, but must either include or exclude it as is. So, eventually, when the slices (numbers) get very very small, it becomes impossible to halve each slice exactly, and so errors begin to creep into the process. Numbers in the computer are stored as binary fractions, and most decimal fractions (and especially irrational numbers like $\\sqrt 2$) cannot be expressed as binary fractions. The actual stored value on the computer is the nearest representable binary fraction. It's not a big problem most of the time, as the errors are typically no more than 1 part in $2^{53}$ per operation. This document recommends using the Python decimal module for high-precision applications [9]. Although calculating the $\\sqrt 2$ is not a high-precision application, I will do it here for comparison."

The more difficult part was coming to the realization that, even if the tolerance for convergence is very small, it doesn't make the answer more precise. In fact, all it does is force the algorithm to take a very long time to produce an estimate for $\\sqrt 2$. I imported some modules purely so that I could compare my answer with other methods. The Python math.sqrt() function produces a slightly better estimate for $\\sqrt 2$, while the decimal module produces the most digits of precision. The conclusion must be that floating point errors might sometimes be a factor to consider when doing calculations on a computer with very small numbers or where high precision is required."

The data is presented in the form of a **contingency table**: a frequency distribution table used to summarize the relationship between several categorical variables [stathow]. Recall that a categorical variable is one that has two or more categories, but there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories [catv]. A typical example might be gender, which has two possible values (traditionally anyway) of male and female. The Chi-squared test can be carried out on a contingency table to check if there is any relationship between the categorical variables. It does so by comparing the observed frequencies of each variable with what we would expect if the variables were actually independent of one another [ssChi2]."
