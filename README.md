## Description

This README describes work done for the Machine Learning and Statistics module project, due 18 December 2020.

We have been asked to complete four tasks:
- one
- two
- three
- four

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/)
- [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [matplotlib: Python plotting library](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit0learn]

### Installing
Download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python from the link above. The other packages (Jupyter notebook, Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, and Scikit-learn) come as part of that distribution.

### Project repository
This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) at
